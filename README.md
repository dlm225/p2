CSCI E-15 Project 2 - XKCD Password Generator

## Live URL
<http://p2.fortmorgan.us>

## Description
This 3-page site features a randomized, high-entropy password generation algorithm. Users can select between 3 and 9 words, and may select zero, one, or two numbers (up to one before and one after) and zero, one, or two special characters (up to one before and one after).  A "What is this site?" page shows the inspiration for this site - an XKCD cartoon strip that attempts to explain a solution to hard-to-remember passwords (though the logic lacks some cryptographic reality). As a bonus (advanced feature), the user can select to generate their password in a number of foreign languages.
